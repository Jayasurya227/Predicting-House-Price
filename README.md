Predicting Housing Market Trends with AI
This project focuses on building a regression model to accurately predict the sale price of houses using the Kaggle "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of a complete machine learning workflow, suitable for a professional portfolio.

The analysis covers essential stages from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced preprocessing to feature engineering, model training (comparing baseline and advanced models), and evaluation.

Dataset: train.csv, test.csv (from Kaggle's House Prices competition) Focus: Demonstrating robust data processing, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques.

Key Techniques & Concepts Demonstrated
Based on the analysis within the notebook, the following key machine learning concepts and techniques are applied:

Target Variable Analysis: Identified and addressed positive skewness in SalePrice using a log transformation (np.log1p) to normalize the distribution.

Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between features and the target variable, identifying top predictors like OverallQual, GrLivArea, GarageCars, and TotalBsmtSF using a correlation heatmap.

Advanced Data Preprocessing: Implemented robust strategies for handling missing values across numerous features, using imputation methods like filling with 0, 'None', the neighborhood median (for LotFrontage), or the mode, based on the feature's context.

Feature Engineering: Created new, potentially more predictive features:

TotalSF: Combined basement, 1st floor, and 2nd floor square footage.

TotalBath: Consolidated full and half bathrooms above and below grade.

Age: Calculated the age of the house at the time of sale.

Categorical Encoding: Applied One-Hot Encoding (pd.get_dummies) to convert categorical features into a numerical format suitable for modeling, after appropriate imputation.

Feature Scaling: Utilized StandardScaler to standardize numerical features for models sensitive to feature scales (like Linear Regression).

Model Building & Comparison: Trained and evaluated two distinct regression models:

A baseline Linear Regression model.

An advanced XGBoost Regressor model.

Model Evaluation: Compared model performance using standard regression metrics: RMSE, MAE, and R-squared, demonstrating the superior performance of XGBoost.

Prediction & Submission: Generated predictions on the test set using the best model (XGBoost), reversed the log transformation (np.expm1), and formatted the output for a Kaggle submission file.

Analysis Workflow
The notebook (3. Predicting Housing Market Trends with AI.ipynb) follows a structured ML process:

Setup & Data Loading: Importing libraries and loading the train/test datasets via the Kaggle API.

Target Variable EDA & Transformation: Analyzing SalePrice distribution and applying log transformation.

Feature EDA: Calculating and visualizing feature correlations with SalePrice.

Data Preprocessing:

Combining train and test sets.

Implementing comprehensive missing value imputation strategies for numerical and categorical features.

Feature Engineering: Creating TotalSF, TotalBath, and Age features.

Categorical Encoding: Applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.

Model Building:

Splitting data into training and validation sets.

Applying feature scaling (StandardScaler).

Training Linear Regression and XGBoost models.

Model Evaluation: Calculating RMSE, MAE, and R-squared for the validation set predictions.

Prediction & Submission File Generation: Making predictions on the scaled test set, reversing the target transformation, and creating submission.csv.

Technologies Used
